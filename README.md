# Cooling Load Calculator

This project contains a simple cooling load calculator web page. The calculator takes user inputs such as building area, number of occupants, building type, outdoor temperature, and desired indoor temperature. Based on these inputs, it calculates the sensible cooling load for the building.

## Demo

You can access the deployed cooling load calculator using the following link:

## Features

- Accepts user inputs for building area, number of occupants, building type, outdoor temperature, and desired indoor temperature.
- Calculates the cooling load based on the type of building (residential or commercial).
- Calculates the heat transfer due to conduction.
- Displays the final sensible cooling load.
